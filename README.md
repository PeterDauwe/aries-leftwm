# Get your code to build your own iso

	git clone https://github.com/PeterDauwe/aries-leftwm


# Use the installation-scripts  in a terminal of your choice
	- 30-build-the-iso-the-first-time.sh will build a Arcolinux-Leftwm as is. Nothing edited.

	- 230-personalized-build-the-iso-timed.sh will build a Aries-Leftwm, but... 
		a) the content of personalsoftware.x86_64 will be added to the iso.
		b) the name of the iso will be changed to Aries-Leftwm


# Or after the installation of a 30-build-the-iso-the-first-time.sh.
	Typ in a terminal : personal
	 (this will copy a .bashrc-personal and a .zsh-personal to your system)

	Close terminal and re-open terminal, typ in a terminal : custom
	 (this will set all icons, themes, and settings of aries-leftwm in place)

Hope you like this, it was fun to make.
